## For this project, I worked on building a text summarization system using NLP (Natural Language Processing). The main idea was to create a tool that can take long pieces of text and generate short, meaningful summaries, which can save a lot of time when dealing with large documents. I used Visual Studio Code as my coding environment and also got help from AI tools like Bolt AI during development. To better understand how to build the system, I referred to a lot of online materials, research papers, and open-source projects. The project was done in Python, and I used popular NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and Hugging Face Transformers. I explored both extractive summarization (picking important sentences from the text) and abstractive summarization (rewriting the summary in new words). This kind of project can be really useful in many areasâ€”like summarizing news articles, academic papers, legal documents, medical records, or even long customer support chats. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I got to see how powerful NLP can be for making sense of large amounts of information quickly.
